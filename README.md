# SportSee : the app to improve your body

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technologies

- JS
- CSS / SCSS
- React
- TypeScript

## Two directories

There is two different directories.
The first one P9-frond-end-dashboard is the backend and is just here to send data to the front-end.

## Lauching the project

You will need to clone the main two repos that you see in this github project and follow the instruction below on how to use this project and the two respectives directories

## BACKEND / P9 Front-end Dashboard ( directory)

#### 2.1 Prerequisites

- [NodeJS (**version 12.18**)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

If you are working with several versions of NodeJS, we recommend you install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). This tool will allow you to easily manage your NodeJS versions.

##### 2.2 Launching the project

- Fork the repository
- Clone it on your computer.
- The `yarn` command will allow you to install the dependencies.
- The `yarn dev` command will allow you to run the micro API.

#### 3. Project (**with Docker**)

##### 2.1 Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

##### 2.2 Starting the project

- The `docker image build --no-cache -t micro-api .` command will allow you to build your image.
- The `docker container run --name micro-api -p 3000:3000 -dt micro-api yarn` command will allow you to create your Docker container and run your image on port 3000.
- The `docker container stop micro-api` command will allow you to stop your micro-api.
- The `docker container rm micro-api` command will allow you to delete your micro-api container.

##### 2.3 Vscode and container remotes

Finally, if you have VsCode, you can easily launch your project in a docker environment.

You will need the [Remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack). Once you have this extension installed, just click on the `Reopen in Container` button.

Once in the container, run the `yarn dev` command.

#### 3. Endpoints

##### 3.1 Possible endpoints

This project includes four endpoints that you will be able to use:

- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}` - retrieves information from a user. This first endpoint includes the user id, user information (first name, last name and age), the current day's score (todayScore) and key data (calorie, macronutrient, etc.).
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/activity` - retrieves a user's activity day by day with kilograms and calories.
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/average-sessions` - retrieves the average sessions of a user per day. The week starts on Monday.
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/performance` - retrieves a user's performance (energy, endurance, etc.).

**Warning, currently only two users have been mocked. They have userId 12 and 18 respectively.**

##### 3.2 Examples of queries

- `http://localhost:3000/user/12/performance` - Retrieves the performance of the user with id 12
- `http://localhost:3000/user/18` - Retrieves user 18's main information.

## FRONT-END / p12

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
